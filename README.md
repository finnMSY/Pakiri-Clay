# README

This website was originally created for a client who wanted to open their own pottery business where they would make sell their own pottery along with bookings for a pottery lesson/retreat sort of thing.
However, due to some complications the website was never publish and therefore, was never properly finished. It is currently a working progress. <br>
While a lot of the things haven't been finished such as the contact page, 'About Me' section, logo, bookings page, admin page, and checkout, a lot has been accomplished such as the store, cart, login, and home pages as well as lots of the sql databases. <br>
This website was created using localhost. <br>
